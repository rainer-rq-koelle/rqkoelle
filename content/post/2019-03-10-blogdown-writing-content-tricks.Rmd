This blogpost is primarily written for my future self. I am notoriously forgettting how things are done.
This is partly linked to me playing around with too many things at the same time or simply not having used a specific feature for a while.
This page hopefully helps filling in as an aide memoire.

## Displaying Code Chunks Without Executing Them 

### Code Chunk Blocks

[Yihui](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/065-rmd-chunk.Rmd) provides examples for displaying verbatim code chunks.
The trick is to destroy the header of the code chunk by inserting an what they call an empty string as inline r code.
I rather say, insert two tick marks as inline code after the chunk header as shown here `` `r
''` ``. These will create the empty string.

```{r eval=TRUE}`r ''`
n = 10
rnorm(x)
```

In order to have the code chunks displayed as a block, intend the whole block by inserting 4 spaces.

    ```{r eval = TRUE}`r ''`
    n = 10
    rnorm(x)
    ```

### Inline R Code

If you want to display inline r code, c.f. above, [Yihui's FAQ #7](https://yihui.name/knitr/faq/) offers 2 ways of doing this:

1. Single backticks can be escaped by double backticks. In order to trick R into not evaluating the inline code, insert a line break immediately after the first backtick and the folloing r `` `r ``. Note: if you check the Rmd of this post, you can see this is how I displayed the two tick marks as inline code above :). As an example, this might help `` `r
1 + 1 ` ``. The inline r code is shown verbatim without executing it.
1. Alternatively, knitr() offers an inline expression function, i.e. `knitr::inline_expr()`. With this you can write `` `r knitr::inline_expr("1 + 1")` ``.
