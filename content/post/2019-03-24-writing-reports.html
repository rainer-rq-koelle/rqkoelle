<div id="overview" class="section level1">
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This post is an aide-memoire for my future me. Throughout the recent months/years I have subsequently moved my writing to RMarkdown.
With the advent of bookdown and blogdown various things have become smoother over time.
Nonetheless, I find myself going back to my past projects to install the same (or similar) set of packages supporting the writing, copy the YAML, etc.</p>
<p>This post shoud save me from going back to past work, but have a centralised place for paste-and-copy the <em>very first steps</em> of all my projects.</p>
<p>Over time, I want to develop this post into a recipe.</p>
<p>When I speak about writing, I predominantly speak about</p>
<ul>
<li>research papers for conferences</li>
<li>technical reports - longer forms of papers ranging from book chapters to longer research reports.</li>
<li>blogging with blogdown - that might actually go elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="rmarkdown" class="section level1">
<h1>RMarkdown</h1>
<p>RMarkdown is pretty cool and it is too straight forward to add more here.</p>
</div>
<div id="technical-reports" class="section level1">
<h1>Technical Reports</h1>
<p><code>bookdown</code> has overcome a lot of the knitr/RMarkdown shortcomings in terms of cross-referencing.
For any type of writing the ‘long formats’ are actually my default go-to.</p>
<div id="installation" class="section level2">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>obviously RMarkdown and bookdown. For RMarkdown open a new file in RMarkdown in RStudio. If not installed, this will result in the (automatic) installation of the required packages.</p>
<pre><code>install.packages(&quot;bookdown)</code></pre>
<p>Dependent on the study complement with tidyverse, lubridate, ggplot2</p>
</div>
<div id="yaml---document-set-up" class="section level2">
<h2>YAML - Document Set-Up</h2>
<p>This is my minimal standard YAML</p>

<p>Redndering to pdf works as a charm. Ditto for MS Word (if needed).</p>

<div id="including-and-cross-referencing-graphics" class="section level2">
<h2>Including and Cross-Referencing Graphics</h2>
<p>There are 3 parts to using a graphic</p>
<ul>
<li>including the graphic</li>
<li>definition of the caption</li>
<li>cross-referencing the graphic</li>
</ul>
<p>The following is a paste-and-copy skeleton.</p>
<pre><code>(ref:cool-caption) This is my cool caption text

    ```{r cool-caption, fig.cap=&quot;(ref:cool-caption)&quot;, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics(&quot;figures/my-cool-figure.png&quot;)
    ```

Lorem ipsum blablabla ... c.f. Fig. \@ref(fig:cool-caption))</code></pre>
<p>Conceptually, the r-chunk label can be different which in turn requires the <code>\@ref()</code> part to link to the different label.
To avoid confustion, simply use the same label and refernce pointer.
Note that the caption reference is <code>(ref: ...)</code> while the refernce to the figure is <code>\@ref(fig: ...)</code> :)</p>
</div>
<div id="bibs" class="section level2">
<h2>Bibs</h2>
<p>It depends a bit on the paper/report and workflow.
Conceptually, a bibtex file entails the references to the cited material.
Bibtex as such has a multitude of entries for all sort of things ranging from books to webpages.
Bibtex is not straightforward, but within certain limits one can easily handle the bib by hand.
For example, I copy the bibtex entry for a reference from scholar.google (or other sources, e.g. IEEE).</p>
<p>!!! If you do bibtex by hand, with the exception of the last entry, check for the comma at the end of each value line!</p>
<p>For more sophisticated work and bibs the use of a Reference Manager Tool is strongly recommended.
Zotero is a great tool. If offers some nice functionality.
Amongst others, one can automatically update a (sub-)collection (read: biblio for your paper). Storing the (sub-)collection in the respecive project folder/repo offers a great workflow for managing references while you go and keep and maintain them in one application.</p>
<p>My aforementioned doing-it-by-hand-approach is not completely off. If hooked up with Zotero, Zotero detects a changed repo and will also read in the changed information.
If not hooked up with Zotero, the resulting project bib can be readily read in and stored.</p>
<p>Thus, the benefit of going for the Zotero-subcollection approach is that one does not need to check for the respective bibtex formats for a reference, and there is no double work for references already stored in the (master) collection.</p>
