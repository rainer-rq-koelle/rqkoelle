During my day-time job I deal with operational performance at airports. 
One recurring graphical requirement is to plot the aerodrome layout.
It follows from this post that there is no ready-out-of-the-box solution for this task.

OpenStreetMap provides geographical information organised in layers.
These layers can be querried for further processing.

The following code snippets shows the OSM query for extracting the feature **aeroway** and associated elements such as apron, gate, etc.    
Consult the documentation to learn more about these element labels.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
bb_lonlat <- c(-0.223915,51.141733,-0.155851,51.165738)
apt_icao  <- "EGKK"
apt_name  <- "London Gatwick"

q <- opq(bbox = bb_lonlat) %>% 
  add_osm_feature(
    key = "aeroway"
    ,value =c("aerodrome", "apron", "control_tower", "gate", "hangar"
              ,"helipad", "runway", "taxiway", "terminal") ) %>% 
  osmdata_sf() %>%
  unique_osmdata()
```
