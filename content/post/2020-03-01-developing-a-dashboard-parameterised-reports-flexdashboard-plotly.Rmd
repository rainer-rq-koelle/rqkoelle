This post summarises my steps in developing a dashboard with interactive static web-pages based on parameterised reports, flexdashboard, and plotly.

## Building Blocks

* parameterised reports
* flexdashboard
* plotly

## Parameterised Reports

this section will be developed.

explain what a parameterised report is and how the data is sourced.
Then move to "rendering" the report with purrr.

## Flexdashboard

this section needs to be developed.

explain how to instantiate flexdashboards
what row-column layout

## Adding Interactivity on Static HTML Pages (no shiny)

### Interactive Graphics with Plotly

explain a few things about plotly.
how to move from ggplot to ggplotly
how to move to plot_ly for more fine-tuning

### Other HTML-Widgets

datatable
summary widget
leaflet
