<p>Despite the on-going COVID19 relaxation today does not invite to go out. It is super-windy day.
Thus, I look at dusting off one of my older to-dos and (re-)launch writing a book on operational performance analysis with R, i.e. ansperf-book.
To be frank, the book should be the companion of a R package. Another to-do I never really get off the ground. But first things first: Get the book infrastructure in hand.</p>
<p>I make use of Emil’s post at <a href="https://www.hvitfeldt.me/blog/bookdown-netlify-github-actions/" class="uri">https://www.hvitfeldt.me/blog/bookdown-netlify-github-actions/</a> and Yihui’s bookdown book at <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/</a>.</p>
<div id="prepare" class="section level2">
<h2>Prepare</h2>
<p>Should not be mentioned, but install</p>
<ul>
<li>RStudio, R … you should have a github account … and netlify</li>
<li>bookdown</li>
<li>usethis</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="getting-started---local-repo" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting Started - Local Repo</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>download the Github repository of bookdown as a <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo/archive/master.zip">zip file</a></li>
<li>and then unzip it locally into your book project folder (in my case the sub-folder is called ansperfbook).</li>
<li>rename the .Rproj file to your project name (ansperf.Rproj).</li>
<li>launch the bookdown skeleton by opening the .Rproj</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to see everything in action: Open the R Markdown file index.Rmd, optionally change or edit a line, and click the button Build Book on the Build tab of RStudio.
This will create several files/folders names bookdown-demo and a book sub-folder.
Go there and check out index.html
To keep your installation clean, delete these files.</p>
</div>
<div id="hook-up-with-git-and-github" class="section level2">
<h2>Hook-up with Git and Github</h2>
<p>This can be readily done with usethis.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>initialise git repo based on project folder: <code>usethis::use_git()</code></li>
<li>git will find some uncommited files. Ignore them by choosing selection option <code>Nope</code> (or <code>No</code>). Note: you will do this later.</li>
<li><p>usethis/git will propose to restart R to initialise the Git pane. Please do so!</p></li>
<li><p>for later create repo on github</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="for-deploying-the-book-setup-netlify" class="section level2">
<h2>For deploying the book setup Netlify</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>go to <a href="https://netlify.com">netlify.com</a></li>
<li>after logging on to Netlify</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>create a “New site from Git”</li>
<li>choose continuous deployment from github</li>
<li>select github repo from the list (!! for this we need to create a repo first)</li>
<li>choose deploy</li>
<li>go to settings and copy ADI ID (i suggest to save this to README)</li>
<li>with change site name, you can pick a more memorable name</li>
<li><p>scroll down to get the status badge, copy it to your clipboard, and insert it at the top of your README</p></li>
<li>next create a netlify access token: Scroll all the way up and click on your icon in the top right corner. Then go to “User settings”
<ul>
<li>go to applications</li>
<li>click <code>new access token</code></li>
<li>provide description and <code>generate token</code></li>
<li>copy the token</li>
</ul>
jump back to your github repo and go to settings
<ul>
<li>go to <code>secrets</code></li>
<li>add new secret
<ul>
<li>one named “NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN” where you put the personal access token as the value and,</li>
<li>one named “NETLIFY_SITE_ID” where you put the API ID as the value.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="create-github-workflow" class="section level2">
<h2>Create Github workflow</h2>
<p>min usethis &gt; 1.5 or install: # install.packages(“devtools”)
devtools::install_github(“r-lib/usethis”)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>run <code>usethis::use_github_action(&quot;bookdown.yaml&quot;)</code></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="make-a-snapshot" class="section level2">
<h2>make a snapshot</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>if renv is not installed: <code>remotes::install_github(&quot;rstudio/renv&quot;)</code></li>
<li>run <code>renv::snapshot()</code></li>
</ol>
<p>renv keeps a log of all packages and ensures consistency across builds.
If new packages are required, add them to the DESCRIPTION (with usethis!)</p>
<p>Notes
the line</p>
<p>netlify deploy –prod –dir _book
in the workflow file it the one that deploys the built book to Netlify. It defaults to the _book folder. In the _bookdown.yml file you can change the output folder. So if you have set it to output_dir: “docs” then you need to change the deploy option to</p>
<p>netlify deploy –prod –dir docs</p>
<p>This finalises the setup of the book project.
All in all the setup took about 30 minutes for the first time, as I had to jump from Emil’s blog to here and test a few things. I need to also change the github repo setup. The github first with a README is light-years simpler.
Let’s see how the book project actually develops.</p>
