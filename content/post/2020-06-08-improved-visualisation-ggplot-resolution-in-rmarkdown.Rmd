One of the ever-nagging Rmd tortures is that with html and MS Word output the visualisations look  ... ahhhhmmm ... shabby.

Found [this]() to set the graphics device and resolution to give super results.
Include the following in the Rmd setup code-chunk:

````
if (knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to") != "latex") {
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(dpi = 300, dev.args = list(type = "cairo"))
})
```` 

Works like a charm!
