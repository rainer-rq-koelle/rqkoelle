# Overview 

For the upcoming round of LearnR at work I plan to make - finally - use of Xaringan slides. 

Xaringan is based on the remark.js and produces html5-slides.

# Preparation

As usual ... install the package from CRAN

````
install.packages("xaringan")
````

or make use of the development version from github:

````
## only install devtools if needed ##
#install.packages(devtools)
devtools::install_github('yihui/xaringan')
```` 

# Kick-off a presentation

To create a xaringan presentation, you create an R Markdown document with the xaringan::moon_reader output format. From within RStudio, it is easy to get started. First click on the New File icon below File and then on R Markdown.

![open xaringan from template submenu](/post/2021-02-07-up-and-running-with-xaringan_files/xaringan-open-from-template.png)

Complete the YAML header with title, author information, and date.    
The *annoying* seal of the template slides is a symbol character of the sub-title (i.e. before the html tag for the linebreak <br/>). It can be removed deleting or overwriting the subtitle. 

Adding `seal: false` option to the YAML `output: xaringan::moon_reader:` section ignores the YAML information. A title slide can then be generated by hand.

Then save your presentation - Rmd file.

![initial YAML for slideshow](/post/2021-02-07-up-and-running-with-xaringan_files/xaringan-open-from-template-YAML.png)

It is worth to click through the `template xaringan` slideshow. It gives an overview of the syntax. At the time of writing this was done on 39 slides. 

## Slide styling

Xaringan is about html slides. Thus, the styling can be done by css.
A **nicer** built-in theme is metropolis.

You can add a css tag to your YAML:

```` 
    css: [default, metropolis, metropolis-fonts]
````

This will load the required css.
Of course you can develop your own css classes and/or themes for xaringan.

## Slide Ratio

The slide ratio can also be set in the YAML:

```` 
...
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    ...
    nature:
      ...
      ratio: 16:9
````

## Slide Numbering

There exists a set of different slide number formats:

````
nature:
      # Examples
      slideNumberFormat: "%current%"                  # 12
      slideNumberFormat: "Slide %current% of %total%" # Slide 12 of 42
      slideNumberFormat: "%current%/%total%"           # 12/42 
````

## Slide basics

* use `---` (3 hyphen to start/separate slides). The first slide will start after the ending hyphens of the YAML.
* headings follow the Rmarkdown notation, i.e. `#` for heading level 1, `##` for level 2, and `###` for 3rd level headings.

## Two Column layout

### 50-50 - Two Evenly Spaced Columns

This is done by wrapping the content of the `left column` into `.pull-left[...]` and the right-column content into `.pull-right[ ...]`. 

```` 
.pull-left[

  Here comes my awesome left-column content.
]
.pull-right[

  And this is what shows up on the right hand side of the slide!

]
```` 

### 20-80 - Small side column and larger content colum

The predefined classes are `.left-colum[]` and `.right-column[]`. For example:

```` 
.left-column[
  Just a left column that has limited width, i.e. about 20%.
]
.right-column[
The awesome main column taking up about 75% of slide width!
]
```` 

## Incremental slides

Incremental slides can be built by separating the on-click elements with 2 hyphens, i.e. `--`.

## Further cool stuff

* using math/LATEX
* including DT, leaflet, plotly, etc.
* highlighing code

## Advanced Code and Plot Classes

Implement Garden Buik stuff here.

# Conclusions

As usual **practice makes perfect**. Thus, establishing slides and mastering the underlying syntax and shorthands is a question of applying it, again, and again, and again ...

What struck me is that putting my first slide set together was done with a minimum of read up. Basically by putting my key lessons learned here. 

If this was useful to you, I am glad that you found what you were looking for. If not let me know what could be added or done better.
