This is an aide memoire / lookup post.  

`{ggplot2}` is awesome. But I find me regularly googling for the things below. This post is a shortcut as I do not need to chase older pages I visited on my questions.

### Force axis limits

with xlim, ylim one "zooms" into the given dimensions or

````
  scale_x_continuous(..., limits = c(0, NA))
```` 

check what expand = c(0,0) is doing - think cutting the additional space.
