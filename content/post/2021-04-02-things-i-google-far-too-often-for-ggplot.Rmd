## Aide memoire & lookup post.  {#top}

`{ggplot2}` is awesome. But I find me regularly googling for the things below. This post is a shortcut as I do not need to chase older pages I visited on my questions.

* [force axis limits](#axislimits)
* [position labels on dodged barcharts](#labeldodgebarchart)

### Force axis limits {#axislimits}

with xlim, ylim one "zooms" into the given dimensions or

````
  scale_x_continuous(..., limits = c(0, NA))
```` 

check what expand = c(0,0) is doing - think cutting the additional space.

### Dodged Barcharts - position text {#labeldodgebarchart}

There is somewhere an awesome SO answer explaining that the position_dodge depends on "data units" and its "resolution". The latter can be querried with `ggplot2::resolution(df$x)`. Its value needs to be multiplied by 0.9. I forgot why but the answer explained that. There are several SO answers with width=1. This works for resolution 1 and 1 * 0.9 ~ 1. If you look carefully, the text is not fully aligned in the middle position.

````
rq %>% ggplot(aes(Date, Value, fill = H2)) +
     geom_col(position = "dodge") +
     geom_text(aes(label = Value), 
               position = position_dodge(width= resolution(rq$Date) * 0.9),
               vjust=1.5)
````

This gives
