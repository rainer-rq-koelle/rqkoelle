<p>This is an aide memoire / lookup post.</p>
<p><code>{ggplot2}</code> is awesome. But I find me regularly googling for the things below. This post is a shortcut as I do not need to chase older pages I visited on my questions.</p>
<div id="force-axis-limits" class="section level3">
<h3>Force axis limits</h3>
<p>with xlim, ylim one “zooms” into the given dimensions or</p>
<pre><code>  scale_x_continuous(..., limits = c(0, NA))</code></pre>
<p>check what expand = c(0,0) is doing - think cutting the additional space.</p>
</div>
