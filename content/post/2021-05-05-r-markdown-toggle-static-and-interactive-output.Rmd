One of the problems I regularly face is to toggle the RMarkdown outputs.
In some instances html pages / document do not work and I have to fall back to - sometimes even - MS Word.    
Throughout the last months bookdowns is more frequently used. 
The multi-page "build" of a document is a tempting feature to have static documents produced on the fly.

For `{plotly}` there is another workaround using `{webshot}` or `{webshot2}` as described in this [older post](2021/02/01/plotly-to-static-image-for-pdf-or-word/). I played around with it and it works. My struggle were to get phantom.js running on my work laptop (no admin rights & IT security settings requiring libraries in certain folders).     
The workflow is then to save out the interactive plot taking a "snapshot" of it and embedding it back into the Rmd. As said, it works. I just do not find it elegant.

This save-out-and-embed-again approach can be emulated by toggling between code-chunks for the static or interactive output.
The cost of this implementation is in the need to code an interactive and static version of the plot (or table).

Still I think this is far more intuitive.

## Toggling code chunks in Rmd

The knitr packages contains two functions supporting the identification of the output render format: 

* `knitr::is_html_output()` and 
* `knitr::is_latex_output()`. 

Evaluating these functions in the code chunk header allows to toggle and use plotly when the output is html and ggplot when the output is pdf.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{ cars}
summary(cars)
```

## HTML only section

```{ eval=knitr::is_html_output(), echo=FALSE}
test_plot <- ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point()
ggplotly(p = test_plot)
```

## PDF only section

```{ eval=knitr::is_latex_output(), echo=FALSE}
test_plot <- ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point()
test_plot
```
