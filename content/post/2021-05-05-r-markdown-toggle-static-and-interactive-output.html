<p>One of the problems I regularly face is to toggle the RMarkdown outputs.
In some instances html pages / document do not work and I have to fall back to - sometimes even - MS Word.<br />
Throughout the last months bookdowns is more frequently used.
The multi-page “build” of a document is a tempting feature to have static documents produced on the fly.</p>
<p>For <code>{plotly}</code> there is another workaround using <code>{webshot}</code> or <code>{webshot2}</code> and <code>phantom.js</code> as described in this <a href="2021-02-01-plotly-to-static-image-for-pdf-or-word/">older post</a>. I played around with it and it works. My struggle were to get phantom.js running on my work laptop (no admin rights &amp; IT security settings requiring libraries in certain folders).<br />
The workflow is then to save out the interactive plot taking a “snapshot” of it and embedding it back into the Rmd. As said, it works. I just do not find it elegant.</p>
<p>This save-out-and-embed-again approach can be emulated by toggling between code-chunks for the static or interactive output.
The cost of this implementation is in the need to code an interactive and static version of the plot (or table).</p>
<p>Still I think this is far more intuitive.</p>

<h2>Toggling code chunks in Rmd</h2>
<p>The knitr packages contains two functions supporting the identification of the output render format:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>knitr::is_html_output()</code> and</li>
<li><code>knitr::is_latex_output()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Evaluating these functions in the code chunk header allows to toggle and use plotly when the output is html and ggplot when the output is pdf.</p>

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see &lt;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com&gt;.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{ cars}
summary(cars)
```

## HTML only section

```{ eval=knitr::is_html_output(), echo=FALSE}
test_plot &lt;- ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point()
ggplotly(p = test_plot)
```

## PDF only section

```{ eval=knitr::is_latex_output(), echo=FALSE}
test_plot &lt;- ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point()
test_plot
```
</code></pre>
