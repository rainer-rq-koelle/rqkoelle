<p>Once every so often I run into problems with TinyTex on my Windows work laptop.
And every time this happens, I realise that I should have jotted down what I did to overcome the issues.</p>
<div id="issues" class="section level1">
<h1>issues</h1>
<p>We cannot use the built in install_tinytex() as this puts the installation in the wrong place.</p>
<p>From time to time additional LATEX packages need to be added.</p>
</div>
<div id="download-and-setup" class="section level1">
<h1>download and setup</h1>
<p>At work we have no admin rights on our laptops. From an IT security perspective, we have been granted some writing and load library rights from the <code>dev</code> subfolder on C.</p>
<p>As we cannot use the install_tinytex, download the latest “release” from</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/yihui/tinytex-releases" class="uri">https://github.com/yihui/tinytex-releases</a></p>
<p>Setup/make sure the path in the Environment Variables is added/correct.</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\rkoelle\dev\TinyTeX\bin\win32</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="download-missing-latex-packages" class="section level1">
<h1>download missing LATEX packages</h1>
<p>Since a while <code>{tinytex}</code> comes with 2 nifty utility functions to check for (or launch immediately the installation of) missing packages.
If knit-to-pdf hangs or fails, run</p>
<ul>
<li>tinytex::parse_packages(“paper.log”) to check for a list of missing package</li>
<li>tinytex::parse_install(“paper.log”) to check and launch the download of the missing package(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>If tinytex coughs up, there is normally an attempt to download the missing packages. I still have not really found out why/when. The text also suggests that the download from the chosen mirror is failing.
However, the messages comprise a pointer to the missing packages.</p>
<p>For example, a recent drill resultet in these messages:</p>
<pre><code>tlmgr.pl: package repository http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet (not verified: unknown)
[1/2, ??:??/??:??] install: IEEEtran [88k]
TLPDB::_install_data: downloading did not succeed (download_file failed) for http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/IEEEtran.tar.xz
[2/2, 07:51/08:09] install: xtuthesis [4k]
TLPDB::_install_data: downloading did not succeed (download_file failed) for http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/xtuthesis.tar.xz
tlmgr.pl: package log updated: C:/Users/rkoelle/dev/TinyTeX/texmf-var/web2c/tlmgr.log</code></pre>
<p>With this one can install the packages by hand</p>
<pre><code>tinytex::tlmgr_install(&quot;nameofmissingpackage&quot;).</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="experience" class="section level1">
<h1>experience</h1>
<p>Might take time! Grab a coffee!</p>
<p>The following ran for a good 20 min on the dummy Rmd page for bookdown::pdf_book:base_format:ieee_article. The rendering failed and executing the parse_packages on the log file took a while. :)</p>
<pre><code>&gt; tinytex::parse_packages(&quot;paper.log&quot;)
tlmgr search --file --global &quot;/IEEEtran.cls&quot;
[1] &quot;IEEEtran&quot;  &quot;xtuthesis&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Most of the times, <code>parse_install()</code> fails. Thus, I regularly do this by hand</p>
<pre><code>tinytex::tlmgr_install(&quot;IEEEtran&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Good luck with updating tinytex!</p>
</div>
