Part of my regular activities is writing papers for conferences. Over time, I have developed a **skeleton** to get me kick-started. Since moving to R & RMarkdown, there is a bit of infrastructure setup involved.

Voila my YAML and basic paper structure for a `{bookdown}`-supported paper using `{rticles}`' IEEE template.
Just paste and copy ... and get going!
