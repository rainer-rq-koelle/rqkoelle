<p>Part of my regular activities is writing papers for conferences. Over time, I have developed a <strong>skeleton</strong> to get me kick-started. Since moving to R &amp; RMarkdown, there is a bit of infrastructure setup involved.</p>
<p>Voila my YAML and basic paper structure for a <code>{bookdown}</code>-supported paper using <code>{rticles}</code>’ IEEE template.
Just paste and copy … and get going!</p>
